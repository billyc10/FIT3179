                Every year thousands of accidents occur on our roads, and hundreds lost their lives to tragic accidents.
                In this series of visualisations we have a look into the statistics behind road accidents.

            As expected, the majority of road fatalities occur in densely populated areas around metropolitan Melbourne.
            This is true especially for pedestrian and cyclist fatalities, as urban regions tend to have a greater density of foot and cyclist traffic.
            However, the map of fatal crashes below (normalised per 10,000 residents) reveals a somehwat surprising statistic:

        <div class="subsection text small paragraph box">
            When we look at fatalities normalised by population, metropolitan Melbourne actually has the lowest road fatality rate.
            Rural areas actually tend to be the more dangerous areas to drive in. This is likely due to the fact that despite its dense population,
            Metro Melbourne has many built-up roads, with traffic lights and low speeds. Rural highways tend to have higher road speeds, narrower lanes, and
            longer distances to travel that lead to fatigue.

                    Victoria's road toll had been on the decrease for 3 years in a row, hitting a record low of 159 in 2018 before spiking back up in 2019.
                    Despite COVID-19 causing state-wide lockdowns for a majority of 2020, the total lives lost on our roads did not drop drastically.

                    The most fatal accidents occur at evening peak hour, between 3pm - 5pm. However, a significant portion of fatalities still occur after dark.
                    Although the roads are quiter, visibility is lower and hooning behaviour is more rampant.

                    Pedestrians and motorcyclists are the most at-risk road users.
                    When a motorcycle is involved in an accident, the rider has over 3 times the chance
                    of dying when compared to driving a vehicle. Despite not being driving a vehicle, 1 in 50 pedestrians struck by cars lose their lives,
                    adding to the increasing figure in the road toll.
